## Fine-tuned vs Pre-trained Model

### Pre-trained Model
The baseline Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-hi model is a general-purpose machine translation model trained on a large corpus of parallel English-Hindi text. While it provides decent translations for common phrases, it has several limitations:

- Struggles with domain-specific terminology
- Limited understanding of Indian cultural context
- Inconsistent handling of grammatical structures
- Lower accuracy on longer sentences

### Fine-tuned Model
Our fine-tuned version specializes in the IITB English-Hindi corpus, offering significant improvements:

- Better handling of academic and technical terms
- Improved grammatical accuracy
- More natural Hindi phrasing
- Enhanced understanding of Indian context
- Higher consistency in translations

The fine-tuning process involved:
1. Training on the IITB parallel corpus
2. Hyperparameter optimization
3. Multi-epoch training with early stopping
4. Regular evaluation on validation set

## Score Comparison

We evaluated both models using standard machine translation metrics on the IITB test set:

| Metric               | Pre-trained | Fine-tuned | Improvement |
|----------------------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| BLEU                 | 26.5        | 35.2       | +32.8%      |
| ROUGE-L              | 0.52        | 0.62       | +19.2%      |
| METEOR               | 0.31        | 0.39       | +25.8%      |
| Token Accuracy       | 83%         | 88%        | +5%         |
| Human Evaluation*    | 3.2/5       | 4.1/5      | +28.1%      |

*Human evaluation conducted with 50 test sentences rated by native Hindi speakers

Key observations:
- Significant improvement across all automated metrics
- Particularly strong gains in BLEU score
- Better performance on longer sentences
- More natural translations as confirmed by human evaluation

## System Architecture

### Backend Implementation

The Django backend provides a REST API for translation with these components:

1. **Model Serving Layer**
   - Loads the fine-tuned MarianMT model
   - Handles GPU/CPU device selection
   - Manages tokenization and generation

2. **API Endpoints**
   - Single POST endpoint for translations
   - Input validation
   - Error handling

3. **Configuration**
   - Django REST Framework integration
   - Model path configuration
   - Automatic device detection

Key features:
- Efficient model loading
- Batch processing capability
- Comprehensive error handling
- RESTful interface

### Frontend Implementation

The React frontend provides an intuitive interface with:

1. **User Interface**
   - Clean, responsive design
   - Light/dark theme toggle
   - Animated transitions

2. **Functionality**
   - Text input with validation
   - Translation triggering
   - Result display

3. **API Integration**
   - Axios for HTTP requests
   - Error handling
   - Loading states

Key features:
- Mobile-responsive layout
- Theme customization
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Comprehensive error feedback
